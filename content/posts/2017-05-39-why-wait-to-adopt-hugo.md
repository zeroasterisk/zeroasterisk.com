Why... oh why... why did I wait so long?

I've been talking about switching to a static site generator for years,
since [jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com/) started gaining popularity.

I understood the benefits, but I had no compelling reason to switch...
_(sort of how I resisted `git` for a few years because `svn` worked well enough)_

But who wants a WordPress site?

Well, ok, maybe you are using 12 plugins and doing fancy stuff.

But if all you are doing is hosting a handful of pages and perhaps blog posts,
Wordpress is just something you have to maintain and worry about security on.

By contrast, static sites are super-cheap or **free** to host, and are **unfuckwithable**.

Anyway, I finally decided that I'd dust off my website,
a [personal site](https://zeroasterisk.com)
and a [code/dev site](https://code.zeroasterisk.com).
I looked at a couple of React static site generators,
and a few other node based ones... but I didn't really like their final static output.
They tried to be too fancy, more like "single-page-app" generators
but what I really want here, is _dead-simple HTML/JS/CSS_.

So I re-reviewed [hugo](https://gohugo.io) again and decided to adopt it.

Reasons for choice:

- Robust community
- Simple static HTML outputs (good for static hosting a multi-page site)
- Simple to extend and modify themes
- Flexible markdown/metadata (mostly)
- Excellent local server for live preview/development
- No dependencies or complicated install (easier to recommend to others)

### How to get started with Hugo

Installation took &lt; 15 minutes:

```sh
brew install hugo
hugo new site zeroasterisk.com
cd zeroasterisk.com
mkdir themes
git clone https://github.com/jeblister/bulma.git themes/bulma
vim config.toml
```

> NOTE there are a lot of pre-built [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io), and once you download,
> they are very easy to customize, preview, and use.

Running the server locally is super simple _(and crazy performant)_:

```sh
$ hugo server -w

```

### How to Migrate from WordPress to Hugo

I had several years of _(sporadic)_ history in WordPress.

I used [SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter)
which is a really simple tool to export WordPress posts/pages into markdown files for Hugo.

1. download zip of plugin
2. unzip into `<my_wordpress_path>/wp-content/plugins/`
3. cd into that dir an `php hugo-export-cli.php`
4. `scp` the `/tmp/wp-hugo.zip` to my laptop

### How to host for free with GitHub and CloudFlare

I already used GitHub for projects.

I already used CloudFlare and had my domain DNS there.

So - I made a GitHub project for
[hugo-zeroasterisk.com](https://github.com/zeroasterisk/hugo-zeroasterisk.com)
and used `gh-pages` branch for the public content...
Here is the [article I followed for setup](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/)
but I did make a few changes when I setup my
[publish_to_gh_pages.sh](https://github.com/zeroasterisk/hugo-zeroasterisk.com/blob/master/publish_to_gh_pages.sh) script.

Once setup - Telling CloudFlare to "listen" to GitHub was as simple as a CNAME setup on CloudFlare and on GitHub.

So now it's hosted, for free, super-fast, on a CDN.
