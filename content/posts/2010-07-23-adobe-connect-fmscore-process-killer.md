We&#8217;ve setup Connect to expire the FMSCore processes after 2 hours, but if someone is still connected to a recording, it will keep the old zombie FMSCore process until that person disconnects.

It often happens that doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; and there&#8217;s seemingly no garbage collection in place to clean up old FMSCore.

So we created a simple AutoIt script which can be compiled to an EXE which works, but it has some dependancies&#8230;

The following dependencies / commands must all be in place:

  * c:\Windows\system32\[pv.exe][1]
  * c:\Windows\system32\[pslist.exe][2]
  * c:\Windows\system32\[pskill.exe][3]

How it works

  * the script uses pv.exe to find all FMS Core processes which have a command line argument that includes &#8220;flvplayerapp&#8221; (which is only for recorded courses)
  * for each of the returned process ids
  * it uses pslist to list details which include the age of the process
  * it uses a regex match find the &#8220;hours it&#8217;s been running&#8221;
  * if longer than 5 hours (a configurable parameter) it uses pskill to kill the process.

So we set this up on an hourly scheduled task and it handles garbage collection for us.
